** Basic app idea **
**SkillSync** is a platform that connects people to exchange skills and work on creative projects together. Users can share what they know, learn new skills, and collaborate in teams. The app features a skill marketplace, project workspaces, live workshops, and a review system to build trust. SkillSync is designed to make learning and collaboration simple, rewarding, and community-driven.

Features include:  
- **Skill Exchange Marketplace**: Users can list skills they want to share (e.g., coding, photography, graphic design) and skills they want to learn, matching them with compatible partners.  
- **Project Hub**: Collaborative workspaces where users can form teams, plan projects, and track progress.  
- **Virtual Workshops**: Host or attend live workshops and classes, with features like screen sharing, whiteboards, and live Q&A.  
- **Skill Endorsements**: Build credibility through reviews and endorsements from past collaborators.  
- **AI Matching**: An algorithm to recommend skill exchange partners or teams based on usersâ€™ profiles, goals, and interests.  
- **Community Forums**: Spaces for discussion, sharing tips, and brainstorming ideas.
